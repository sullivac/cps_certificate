# cps_certificate

An example cookbook for importing a PFX certificate using PowerShell modules
instead of the `windows_certificate` resource for the
[`windows`](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/windows) cookbook.

## Test Kitchen

I used AWS to test converge this cookbook. I've removed any sensitive
information from `.kitchen.yml` and marked it `<redacted>`. Replace these with
real values to test.
